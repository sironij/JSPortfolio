        <p>A black line, an endless set of points. Each one’s life which goes on, changes, and enriches itself. <br>
          The black line represents the way you decide to choose, to travel and to put together with the different choices of your life, as well as the limit within you should organize your expecta- tions or future ideas or even the barrier you must
          cross just like limits and difficulties which appear to each of us. <br>
          This way won’t be a law, but a collection of ideas and thoughts from which you can draw inspiration, through which you can be encouraged in researching and being curious. You can also use it as a street to walk on or even to move away and
          get back stronger and more conscious.<br>
          The goal of THE BLACK LINE is the right communication. This communication is turned toward the future in both themes and thoughts: the future we want to speak about is made of hope and fear. This future excites us but also scares us, it is
          unavoidable but at the same time per- sonal and unique. Therefore, the main purpose is to give the reader food for deeper thoughts regarding current contents and a look to the future. Every people have an active part in their own life and
          in the social and cultural environment we are in. It’s time to speak clearly and directly to the reader, who is the one and only main character of his life. The engagement of the reader starts from the belief that the words of everyone add
          value to the entire society. We give a positive, stimulating and innovative vision of passing apparently insurmountable obstacles: accurate themes about society and environment which, most of the times, appear to be so far away to our
          every-day life. Good will destroys boundaries. <br>
          The theme of the first issue is movement. A phenomenon of growth, exchange and fusion. editor’s letter
          Active relationships between a person and the external world, between two people, and between a person and the internal world are just examples. Fashion and lifestyle permit us to make exchange, they make us permeable and variable.
          Boundaries fall down creating a com- plete balance: between gender and generation, between human being and nature, between nature and architecture, and between architecture and human being.
