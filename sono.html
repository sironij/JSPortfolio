        <p>sòno is an area of experimentation that allows you to perceive through sound one's own personal space and someone else's. A system tracks users' positions by creating a virtual environment where the sound is spatialized and increases or
          decreases as the distance between participants varies.</p><p>
          The sense of proxemic space qualifies us as human, but we often perceive it unconsciously. The sound translates it and allows the perception to be isolated.<br>
          In addition to the production of specific sounds that identify each user, the experience has been digitally translated on a website that adds in-depth information about concept. The tracks have been published on <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6558SlU91srZBKS16rJFbz?highlight=spotify:track:54a92g7g8V2hSJ8vulONdZ target=" _blank"">spotify</a> and a polystyrene sound box has been built to recall the motif of the visual.

          COMMUNICATION</p><p>
          The engagement of visitors begins before the exhibition and depends on interaction with "sound totems", sculptures with organic forms placed in strategic points of passage. The user approaches, attracted by the sounds and the lack of
          context of the sculpture. Using the music recognition app Shazam discovers the information needed to reach the exhibition, integrated with the metadata of the track. Totem communication is complemented by a more traditional poster-based
          campaign. The posters are not explicit: they suggest key words related to the world of personal space, contextualize the mysterious atmosphere of the installation and anticipate its hybrid man-machine component.<br><br>


          INSTALLATION</p><p>
          The visitor approaches the installation. The first thing he sees is a live visual that seems to be connected to the movement of active users within a defined area. No sound is heard. The visitor is explained the rules of the installation,
          wears headphones, moves freely in the play area experimenting sound variations depending on his own personal space in relation to that of others. In this case the communication is entrusted to modular postcards that represent sections of
          the visual and that report a brief description of the installation as well as the indications on the project web page.<br><br>


          POST-EXPERIENCE</p><p>
          The communication of sòno continues on the web page s-u-ono.com, developed to extend the experience, explain its rationale and collect the documentation of the project. The site consists of two main sections. In the first one the user can
          experience a simplified version of the installation, a 2D interactive game in which the mouse controls the position of a circle and the sound carpet varies according to the distance from other randomly moving circles. The second page
          provides the cultural and design framework of the installation, the vertical navigation is accompanied by the animation of the visual projected at the exhibition.<br><br><br><br>
