          Three subjects confront each other and within themselves: they express their persona through fashion, beyond their gender and age. This is Morph by Azzurra Cossi and Jacopo Sironi, a photography work focused on the body and its
          transformation over time and personality. And this is how today’s society makes room for us and allows our growth along the way, destroying the rules and undermining ancient and bigoted dictates.
          A form in continuous movement, in perpetual change.<br>
          As in Klimt’s painting “The Three Ages of Woman” we find ourselves in front of the inexorable passage of time in the female figure, we relate to these subjects: a child, a boy and an old woman. Although there is one big difference: while in
          Klimt evolution is limited to the female figure, in Morph the growth is univocal and multiple. Children who wear black swan’s costumes, old women who dress in camp style, everything is allowed, nothing is excluded. The provocation is clear:
          the outfits of the characters get through the lens and ask a simple and irrelevant question: do you really want to limit yourself to judge?<br>
          Provocation and courage overlap, it is difficult to distinguish one from the other. This is the meaning that fashion assumes in this project: it is an instrument in the hands of the subjects to provoke society and, at the same time, the end
          through which to express one’s own persona, one’s courage to oppose it.<br>
          A necessity that will become vain only when we manage to get rid of moldy labels under the dust and light of a different reality.
