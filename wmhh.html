        <p>Design is commonly understood as the solution to any problem. Once design reached its maturity it started to question itself: that’s how speculative design was born.<br>
          In a world full of answers, we should find questions that are really meaningful. Our goal is not to answer,
          but to ask: in this exhibition design doesn’t claim to provide solutions, but just new problems.<br>
          Our question is: What makes humans human?</p><p>
          A query that sounds easy, but hides an underlying complexity. What is it that makes us human?<br>
          Which are the features that define our uniqueness from all other living creatures?<br>
          The communication devices on display are meant to stimulate a debate, to bring your attention to a new way of looking at everyday life. Isn’t asking new questions an intrinsic trait of human nature?
          This exploration is endless and controversial, but it indicates a specific attitude: the ability to reflect and to create stories in which to believe in. Each team that took part to the exhibition tried to analyze
          the main theme under a specific point of view creating twelve different projects.</p><p>

          Twelve projects to question and reflect on human nature, twelve communication project exercises. Twelve experiences, for the user and for the students who designed them.
          A process of educational experimentation based on the risk of finding solutions and techniques and verifying them at real scale. Design speculation not meant to give answers and certainties, but to build new
          questions and think about uncertainty. A way to go beyond problem-solving and recognizing problem-finding as an opportunity.
          A learning path that overcomes the centrality of the téchne and challenges knowledge.</p><p>


          "WMHH?" is an exhibition of Speculative Design, which hosts the projects of the synthesis course of undergraduate students of the three-year communication course. The art direction involves the coordination of different teams for the
          creation of an identity system for the promotion, experience and documentation phases of the event.<br>
          Asking questions is the quality that most defines us as human beings, so each project is associated with a provocative question on a specific human issue. <br>
          The <a href="https://issuu.com/tea.riva/docs/catalogodefinitivo_small__1_" target="_blank">catalogue</a> of the exhibition projects was print in offset with 2 pantones on unbound large format sheets. In addition to this,
          a wayfinding system, a <a href="http://humans.labsintesi-c1.info/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>, a video trailer, a reportage and a social campaign were produced. The <a href="http://www.aiap.it/notizie/15112/"
            target="_blank">exhibition</a> was set up on 18 and 19 March 2019 at Spazio BASE
          in Milan and hosted more than 1000 visitors.
